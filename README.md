CAD
===========
I have decided to use Solidworks as my CAD tool for OddBot. This is primarily because most of my experience is in Pro-Engineer/Creo, and from what I have tried Solidworks seems pretty good.

3. Ethernet switch

4. Wi-Fi Antenna
  - Size: Non-rectangular shape, envelope ~ 60mm x 60mm x 60mm

I modeled up cubes for the parts, and decided on an initial frame using metric T-Slots, outside dimensions 220mm x 220mm x 150 mm.
